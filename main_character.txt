Name: Kaelen "Kael" Valerius
Age: 28
Personality: Kael is a brilliant but reclusive xenolinguist, more comfortable with ancient alien dialects than with people. He's driven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep-seated belief that understanding lost languages is the key to preventing future cosmic conflicts. Beneath his often-brusque exterior lies a dry wit and a surprisingly sentimental attachment to the few artifacts he's recovered.
Defining Flaw/Motivation: Kael is haunted by the loss of his mentor, who disappeared while researching a forbidden language. This fuels his obsessive drive to uncover forgotten knowledge, often pushing him to ignore safety protocols and alienate potential allies in his quest for answers, believing he's the only one who can complete his mentor's work and prevent a similar catastrophe.
