1. CLOSE UP: Kael Valerius, eyes wide with a mix of terror and revelation, deciphers a glowing, unstable alien glyph that suddenly flares, throwing him back from his console as alarms blare. (Mood: Intense, revelatory, dangerous)

2. WIDE SHOT: A vast, derelict starship graveyard hangs silent in the eerie green glow of the Sargasso Nebula, a tiny scavenger vessel cautiously navigating through the colossal, fractured hulls. (Mood: Ominous, mysterious, isolated)

3. QUICK CUT: A data-stream, visualized as a torrent of corrupted light, surges through Neo-Alexandria's data-hubs, causing city-wide blackouts and panic as screens fill with static. (Mood: Chaotic, urgent, threatening)

4. SLOW MOTION: A lone figure in a weathered spacesuit touches a colossal, ancient stone tablet covered in unknown symbols, a faint pulse of energy emanating from its surface in the darkness of a newly discovered alien vault. (Mood: Awe-inspiring, ancient, hopeful yet perilous)
